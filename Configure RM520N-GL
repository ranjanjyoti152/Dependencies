# How to Set Up the RM520N-GL Modem on a Jetson Device

# Prepare Your Jetson Device:
# Flash the Jetson device with the appropriate software if not already done.
# Attach the RM520N-GL module to your Jetson device.
# Connect the antenna to the modem and insert the SIM card into the modem.
# Remove the Default Modem Manager: Open a terminal on your Jetson and run the following commands to remove the default modem manager:

sudo apt-get remove --purge modemmanager -y
sudo apt autoremove -y

# Download the Necessary Drivers: Run these commands to download and unzip the required drivers:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranjanjyoti152/Dependencies/main/pcie_mhi.zip
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranjanjyoti152/Dependencies/main/qmi_wwan_q.zip
unzip pcie_mhi.zip
unzip qmi_wwan_q.zip

# Install the Drivers: Follow these steps to install the drivers:

cd pcie_mhi
make
sudo make install
cd ..
cd qmi_wwan_q
make
sudo make install
cd ..

# Reboot the Jetson Device: After installing the drivers, reboot your device:

sudo reboot

# Test Network Connectivity:
# Install the minicom tool, which will help you communicate with the modem:

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install minicom -y

# Configure minicom:

sudo minicom -s

# In the menu, select Serial Port Setup.
# Change Serial Device to /dev/ttyUSB2.
# Enable Software Flow Control.
# Save the setup and exit minicom.

# Activate the Network (One-Time Setup):
# Start minicom:

sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2

# In the minicom terminal, type these commands one at a time (ignore any errors):

AT+QCFG="usbnet",3
AT+QNETDEVCTL=2,3,1
AT+CFUN=1,1

# Check the Network Connection: Open a new terminal and check for network connectivity by verifying if USB 0 or 1 has an IP address. 
# Then, reboot the device again:

sudo reboot

# Set Up Automatic Network Connection on Restart:
# Download a script that will automate the modem connection process:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranjanjyoti152/Dependencies/main/modem.sh
chmod +x modem.sh

# Open the crontab editor to run this script at startup:

crontab -e

# Choose nano as the editor.
# Add this line to the end of the file:

@reboot /home/proxpc/modem.sh

# Press Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit.

# Give Permissions for minicom to Run Without a Password: Open the sudoers file to allow minicom to run without needing a password:

sudo visudo

# Add this line to the file:

proxpc ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/minicom

# Press Ctrl+O to save and Ctrl+X to exit.

# Final Reboot: Reboot your system to apply all changes:

sudo reboot

# Youâ€™re all set! Now your Jetson device will automatically connect to the network when it starts up.
